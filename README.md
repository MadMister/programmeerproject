# project

This app will be designed for peolpe who want to easily check and analyse chess games, like they check their instagram or anything of the likes. It will resolve the problem of having to search the internet for games, sometimes without being able to interact with the board in any way.

The app will feature a main screen at which one can request a game at random, or staisfying certain criteria, such as the name of a player or the year it was played. Once a search button is hit, random games, or games satisfying the given criteria will be diplayed and games will be clickable to see details.

When a game is clicked, a chess board will be initialised and the user can see a list of moves played in chess notation. Also, a player can click 'next move' and 'previous move' buttons, to visualise these moves on the board and at any moment the user is able to stop following the moves played in te game and drag pieces around to create a new game path and store any game, unaltered or altered.

The chess library that will be used, will be one by nvzqz and can be found [here](https://github.com/nvzqz/Sage)

The API to request games will be the [chess galery API](https://chess.gallery/api/gameref#game)
