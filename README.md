# project

The aim of this project will be to design an app that loads chess games of high level chess tournaments. This information is widely available on the internet, yet just like news apps, it would be nice to have a quick overview of everything you are looking for within one app. The people who really need this in their lives are those who want to catch up with the latest matches just as easily as checking their instagram.

The app will contain a list with all current tournaments that have two buttons attached, one yielding the leaderbord of that tournament, the other yielding a list of games played in that tournament.

Once the second button is clicked, a list with games of that tournament will appear that are clickable for more detail. Whenever a game is clicked, the following things will appear:
*A chessboard with teh initial setup
*The format in which the game is played
*A list with the moves in chess notation
*Buttons to see the moves be played on the board on screen (next and previous move)
